        <p>The future is digital, sustainable and highly complex. It is a fact that for businesses to thrive they have to be sustainable from a social and environmental perspective. Their solutions need to operate in an often complex and rapidly changing world. My firm belief is that those solutions are small, simple and easy to understand. Needless to say that solutions and processes that we create today are born with an extreme potential to outpace the solutions of yesterday because of digitalization. More often than not the simpler solutions can create the best outcome to complex problems. I believe that it is the best way of future proofing value creation in a complex and rapidly changing world.</p>
